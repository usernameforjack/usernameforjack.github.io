    <h2>Rear Window</h2>
    <p>Laid up with a broken leg, photojournalist L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is confined to his tiny, sweltering courtyard apartment. To pass the time between visits from his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fashion model girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), the binocular-wielding Jeffries stares through the rear window of his apartment at the goings-on in the other apartments around his courtyard. As he watches his neighbors, he assigns them such roles and character names as "Miss Torso" (Georgine Darcy), a professional dancer with a healthy social life or "Miss Lonelyhearts" (Judith Evelyn), a middle-aged woman who entertains nonexistent gentlemen callers. Of particular interest is seemingly mild-mannered travelling salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), who is saddled with a nagging, invalid wife. One afternoon, Thorwald pulls down his window shade, and his wife's incessant bray comes to a sudden halt. Out of boredom, Jeffries casually concocts a scenario in which Thorwald has murdered his wife and disposed of the body in gruesome fashion. Trouble is, Jeffries' musings just might happen to be the truth. One of Alfred Hitchcock's very best efforts, Rear Window is a crackling suspense film that also ranks with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960) as one of the movies' most trenchant dissections of voyeurism. As in most Hitchcock films, the protagonist is a seemingly ordinary man who gets himself in trouble for his secret desires.It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's inspired audience-participation films: watching it, you feel titillated, horrified, and, ultimately, purged.</p>

     <h2>Baby Driver</h2>
    <p>A talented, young getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack to be the best in the game. But after being coerced into working for a crime boss (Kevin Spacey), he must face the music when a doomed heist threatens his life, love and freedom.</p>
    <p>There’s not a great deal more to the movie than this—but why should there be? Wright directs it all with infectious verve, whether it’s Baby sashaying down the sidewalk to “Harlem Shuffle” or the camera swirling around a romantic dinner between Baby and Debora with a giddy joy that recalls the “Kiss the Girl” scene in The Little Mermaid. Best of all are the car chases, which Wright choreographs with the same blend of wit and technical finesse he brought to the pool-cue,“Don’t Stop Me Now” zombie rumble in Shaun of the Dead.  Wright’s greatest triumph is the musically choreographed action that swing and shoots to the beat.  One of the most innovative uses of a soundtrack in an action movie, and deserves a few hours of your time.  Earbuds out!</p>
