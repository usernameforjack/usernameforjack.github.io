    <h2>Shawshank Redemption</h2>
    <p>Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy learns to get by in the brutal confines of prison, even earning the respect of his fellow inmates, most notably the longtime convict "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman).</p>
    <p>The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a "prison drama" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word "redemption" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.</p>
    <p>The film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.</p>

     <h2>Good Will Hunting</h2>
    <p>Matt Damon, who created the title character and wrote the script with costar Ben Affleck, gives a star-making performance as a working class genius with a chip on his shoulder.</p>
    <p>Will Hunting is the dream part Damon and Affleck willed (so to speak) into existence. He is tough, brilliant, wild and vulnerable. When a Harvard post-graduate condescends to Chuckie in a bar, Will destroys him by quoting chapter and verse of the books that he is plagiarising. Damon gets both the exhilarating ease of Will's intellect and the terrible turmoil that lurks beneath it. In the smaller role of Chuckie, Affleck is superb too. The actors' friendship infuses the film: their best scenes are boyish badinage. And Affleck - surely by design - gets his own big scene, in which he impersonates his mate at a job interview, a hilarious but also wrenching mimicking of what he takes to be intelligence (the use of words like "aforesaid"), and then touches his interrogators for a few dollars.</p>
    <p>But Damon and Affleck were smart enough to realise that they wouldn't get their script filmed just by writing good parts for themselves. They needed a major star, and so they dangled the prospect of a great supporting role before the A-list names. The part is that of Will's psychiatrist, a native of the same Boston south side, whose own life has gone off the rails, and who goads Will into maturity. Robin Williams took the bait, and he gets to deliver two speeches so juicy they look set to become actors' audition pieces: one about the virtue of imperfection, the other a hostile lecture to Will on the difference between knowledge and experience. Those with low schmaltz tolerances may gag, but Williams just about brings off the double of sharpness and tenderness.  Most of all, this movie tells a story of a broken young man who gets help for the first time in his life.  The actors nail their characters, and the performance will leave a lasting impression no matter how old you are or what kind of movies you enjoy.</p>
