A markup language is identified as a system for annotating a document so that it is syntactically distinguishable.  The most common of these in the modern internet it HTML.  A website recieves a HTML code that tells the computer how to format a website and creates the display.

    <h2>Basic HTML</h2>
    <p>Every HTML document will start with the &lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;. This tag identifies the document language as html and is immediately followed &lt;html&gt;. The html tag encompases the entire document identifing the code as html. The html code is made up of two main blocks. The head and the body. The head will contain any metadata about the document and is enclosed by the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tags to identify the code as a part of the head block. The secondary block is the body, which holds the content of the document. This block is enclosed with the tags &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;.  The content of the document is written using various block elements for paragraphs, headers, images, and so forth.</p>
